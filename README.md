This is a fully responsive mockup of the new york times online newspaper.

# Intructions
This is a static site that only uses HTML and CSS.

# Lessons Learned
I truly learned how to build any kind of user interface I could possivle imagined.

# Future Enhancements
I used float to creates the different sections. I could now change it to flex box instead of using flaot. I could also switch to SASS instead of just plain and simple CSS. I plan to make these changes for practice.
